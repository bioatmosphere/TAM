# Taming Root Systems Complexity to Reduce Earth System Model Uncertainty
From phenology, allocation, stochiometry, maintenance, and mortality to structural and functional differentiation to larger spatial and temporal variability, all aspects related to plant root systems' dynamics will be examined with an eventual goal of robust representation in Earth System Models--That is, **Taming Root Systems Complexity to Reduce Earth System Model Uncertainty**.

## Initial Efforts(project_root_dyanmics/)
I am exploring possibilities with sELM(simple_ELM).

### UQ
Performed with UQTk (v3.0.2;https://github.com/sandialabs/UQTk) under Python(2.7.5), cmake(3.11.0), and gcc(6.3.0)

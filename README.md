# TAM-Tansport and Absorptive roots with Mycorrhizal fungi
As accelerated empirical advances in the last two decades establish clearly functional differentiation conferred by the hierarchical structure of fine-root orders and associations with mycorrhizal fungi, a need emerges to embrace this complexity to bridge the data-model gap in still extremely uncertain models. **Here, we propose a 3-pool structure comprising Transport and Absorptive fine roots with Mycorrhizal fungi (TAM) to model vertically resolved fine-root systems across organizational and spatial-temporal scales. Emerging from a conceptual shift away from arbitrary homogenization, TAM builds upon theoretical and empirical foundations as an effective and efficient approximation that balance realism and simplicity**.
